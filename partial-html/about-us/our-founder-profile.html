            <li>My name is Tran Thi Nga. I am 38 years old and currently have three children.</li>

            <li> I am originally from Nghe An province in central Vietnam. My passion for the Japanese language and
                culture led me to relocate to Ho Chi Minh City in 2005 so I could pursue my university studies in
                Japanese.
                Presently, I live in Ho Chi Minh City and have approximately 15 years of experience working as an
                assistant and general manager at Japanese companies.</li>

            <li> There were times when my hectic work schedule left me with no time for myself, my parents, and my
                family.
                Living far away from home made it difficult for me to see my family frequently and sometimes to take
                care of my loved ones as I wished. To this day, I still regret those times.</li>

            <li> I do not want anyone else to go through such similar experiences as mine. I hope everyone can have a
                happy and balanced life.</li>

            <li> Therefore, I aspire to help busy individuals reduce their burdens so they can spend more time with
                their loved ones and take care of themselves.
                Helping others live happier lives and achieve what is important to them is something I'm passionate
                about.
            </li>
            <li> I would be delighted if I could help people become happier and feel less lonely.</li>
